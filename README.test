The tests are held in test/framework/, but tests should be run from this
directory.  test/support_files/ are files used by the tests, for example for
regression.  test/subjects/ are the files used to test phc. Most are designed
to test some feature or tickle some bug. test/subjects/labels controls what
tests are run on which subjects. test/logs/ contains logs of failed tests.

To run tests:

	$ make test (aka make check)
or
	$ make installcheck
or
	$ make long-test
or
	$ php tests/scripts/driver.php

The latter allows command line options, and limiting the tests with regular
expressions. Run driver.php with the '-h' flag for details.

In order to run tests on your own php files, add the files to
test/subjects/3rdparty/, and list them in subjects/3rdparty/labels. In order to
generate the support files, for example if you'd like the regression tests to
succeed rather than be skipped, run

	$ make generate-test-files

By default, 3rdparty tests are treated as 'long', so need to be run with

	$ make long-test
