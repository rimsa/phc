/*
 * Garbage collection:
 *
 *	We use the Boehm garbage collector for C++. This creates a very small number
 *	of rules that we need to follow. Failure to follow these rules will
 *	typically lead to the garbage allocator prematurely collecting objects,
 *	leading to segfaults. (Note: object on the stack are NOT excepted).
 *
 *	1. _ALL_ (let me repeat, ALL) classes which we define need to inherit from GC_obj.
 *	2. Its OK to use string or stringstream on the stack, since they dont
 *		contain other objects, they get cleared up on going out of scope, and they
 *		appear everywhere.
 *		TODO: do we clear up the result of stringstream::str()
 *	3. Never use STL objects without wrapping them. For example:
 *		-	Create Map to wrap std::map, either using gc_allocator as the
 *			allocator, or inheriting from Object. It _should_ inherit from Object and
 *			support the clone() method, but that may not yet be implemented. If it is
 *			not, it inherits from GC_obj instead.
 *	4. When using embedded PHP, do garbage collection manually. If garbage
 *		collected objects need to be put in PHP structures (which they currently
 *		dont), then the memory must be allocated using libgc's traceable
 *		allocators, which traces, but doesn't deallocate memory.
 *	5. For exceptional objects allocated with new, use the placement new form:
 *			int* a = new (GC) int;
 *		If they need to be traceable but not collectable, use the other placement new form:
 *			int* a = new (NoGC) int;
 *
 *
 * TODO: it may be necessary to include libgc within phc to ensure that it is
 * compiled correctly for our use.
 *
 * TODO: should libgc be mandatory (fail to compile without it)? it exists on all platforms...
 * 
 * TODO: what does libgccpp do for us? It doesnt fix the bugs by magic...
