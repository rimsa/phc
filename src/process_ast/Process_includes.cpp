 * The include functionality is described in http://php.net/include/. 
 *
 * We support:
 * - include statements whose parameter must be a literal string
 * - the included file being in the current directory or the directory
 *	  containing the file being parsed
 * 
 * 
 * We don't support:
 * - return statements in the included file
 * - the '$val = include('my_file.php');' construct
 * - get_included_files()
 * - proper error messages. If it fails, we leave in the include statement
 * - using include_path to get the correct include path
 *
 * TODO
 * - return statements and the complications they entail
 *
 * We intend to support in the future (but probably in the IR):
 * - include statements whose parameter can be derived using constant
 *   propegation or other dataflow analysis
 * - Run-time inclusion
 * - Remote compile-time or run-time inclusion
 */

/* These statements are culled from the manuals.
 *
 * Any variables available at that line in the calling file will be
 * available within the called file, from that point forward.
 *
 * However, all functions and classes defined in the included file have
 * the global scope.
 *
 * If the include occurs inside a function within the calling file, then all of
 * the code contained in the called file will behave as though it had been
 * defined inside that function. So, it will follow the variable scope of that
 * function.
 *
 * - We put the code directly inside the calling function, which handles all these cases.
 *
 * Because include() and require()  are special language constructs, you
 * must enclose them within a statement block if it's inside a conditional
 * block.
 *  - This is handled automatically by the parser
 *
 * $bar is the value 1 because the include was successful. Notice the
 * difference between the above examples. The first uses return() within the
 * included file while the other does not. If the file can't be included, FALSE
 * is returned and E_WARNING is issued.
 * - We dont support this. The warning is left to the run-time.
 *
 * Handling Returns: It is possible to execute a return()  statement
 * inside an included file in order to terminate processing in that file and
 * return to the script which called it. Also, it's possible to return values
 * from included files. You can take the value of the include call as you would
 * a normal function. This is not, however, possible when including remote
 * files unless the output of the remote file has valid PHP start and end tags
 * (as with any local file). You can declare the needed variables within those
 * tags and they will be introduced at whichever point the file was included.
 *  - TODO We'll handle returns in the IR, since the IR has goto, which these
 *         really need. Also, contructs like '$a =
 *         do_something(do_something_else(include('myfile.php')))' are easy to
 *         support in the IR and nasty to support in the AST.
 *
 * If there are functions defined in the included file, they can be used in the
 * main file independent if they are before return() or after. If the file is
 * included twice, PHP 5 issues fatal error because functions were already
 * declared, while PHP 4 doesn't complain about functions defined after
 * return(). It is recommended to use include_once() instead of checking if the
 * file was already included and conditionally return inside the included file.
 *  - Redefined functions and classes lead to an error. However, there may be
 *    some bugs in this, which cant really be resolved without data flow.
 *    Include_once at your peril.
