 *		in the pass should be the macro CTS (NAME).
 *		- CTS stands for 'Compile-Time-Statistic'
 *		- It simply adds one to a counter, which is specific to NAME.
 *		- After each pass, if --stats is enabled, all live counters are printed.
 *		- The is (currently) no need to save the stats after a pass ends.
