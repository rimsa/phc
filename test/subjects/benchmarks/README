PHPBench: http://www.pureftpd.org/project/phpbench

	PHPbench will need a bit of modification to do good work, which negates the point somewhat. It has a divide by zero in it, which we should remove, and also an infinite loop.

	It also loads tests like this (AKA dynamic class loading):
		$dir = opendir ($test_dir);
		while ($entry = readdir ($dir))
		{
			include_once ($entry);
		}

	Try optimizing that.
