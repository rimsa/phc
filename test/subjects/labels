# All files will be found by recursive descent of directories, and each found
# file will be assigned the default labels. This is then overriden by matching
# each file against each line in this file, in order. The pattern is specified
# as a regex, but ! is used as a regex delimiter, so you can safely use / in
# the patterns. 
#
# Be aware that all files in a directory are specfied use 'dir/.*', not 'dir/*'.
#
# Possible labels:
#	- non-interpretable or interpretable (interpretable means executable). The
#	    default is to run a purity test to check if they are interpretable
#	- long (default) or short
#	- size-neutral (default) or size-dependent
#	- non-includable (default) or includable
#	- no-test_name (don't run with a particular test)
#
# A common pattern would be to override some tests by adding, for example, the
# following to the bottom of the file:
#	.*				non-interpretable
#	codegen/.*	interpretable

# Counter-intuitive: Invalid tests which accidentally pass are only caught when
# they dont run by the fact that they fail when we interpret them. However,
# they will be skipped if BasicParseTest finds the error, so its safe to label
# them as interpreted.
