# All files will be found by recursive descent of directories, and each found
# file will be assigned the default labels. This is then overriden by matching
# each file against each line in this file, in order. The pattern is specified
# as a regex, but ! is used as a regex delimiter, so you can safely use / in
# the patterns. 
#
# Be aware that all files in a directory are specfied use 'dir/.*', not 'dir/*'.
#
# Possible labels:
#	- non-erroneous (default) or erroneous
#	- non-interpretable (default) or interpretable (interpretable means executable)
#	- long (default) or short
#	- size-neutral (default) or size-dependent
#	- non-includable (default) or includable
#	- no-test_name (don't run with a particular test)
#
# A common pattern would be to override some tests by adding, for example, the
# following to the bottom of the file:
#	.*				non-interpretable
#	codegen/.*	interpretable

bugs/.*								short interpretable
codegen/.*							short interpretable
dynamic/.*							short interpretable
general/.*							short interpretable
horrible/.*							short interpretable
inline-c/.*							short non-interpretable
php_bugs/.*							short interpretable

# we dont support the features used by files in unsupported. Check that they
# parse, and no more.
