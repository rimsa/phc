Note that this is designed for PHP4. It seems to work out of the box with PHP5.

The following packages are used (debian/ubuntu):
	apache2
	libapache2-mod-php5
	php5-mysql
	mysql-server-5.0
	mysql-client-5.0


The following webpages provide documentation:

	http://jmob.objectweb.org/rubbos.html 
		- Poor documentation, main home page. Release 2.x dont have docs, look for release 1.0.

	http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer/
	http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer/RUBBoS/download.html
		- Contains release 1.0, which includes the docs.

	http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer/dyna_bottleneck.pdf
		- Section 4 describes benchmarks utilization.
		- There is another paper of this ilk.


Howto run the benchmark:

Step 1 - get the webserver running:

	I put a symlink to the RUBBos directory from within ~/public_html, and access it at
	http://localhost/~me/RUBBoS/

	apache needs the php module, and PHP needs the mysql module. On ubuntu:
		$ sudo a2enmod userdir
		$ sudo a2enmod php5

	None of the links work in this config, so they need to be patched. In the PHP/ directory:
		$ sed -i 's!/PHP/!!g' *.php
		$ sed -i 's!/PHP/!!g' *.html

Step 2 - Set up the databases

	Download the database:
		- http://download.forge.objectweb.org/rubbos/rubbos-expanded-dataset.tar.bz2

	Create a user for the database
		- I created 'rubbos' with no password (I did this with phpmyadmin, not sure how to do
		  otherwise).

	The database directory has 3 files to set up the DB:
		Create the tables and the DB.
			- I created a DB rubbos when I created the user, so didn't need the first line of rubbos.sql.
			$ mysql -u rubbos < rubbos.sql

		Load the data from the downloaded, unzipped rubbos-expanded-dataset into the database.
			- Need top change the filenames before executing.
			$ mysql -u rubbos rubbos < load.sql
				(I had a problem with this, so had to use
					$ mysql -u root rubbos < load.sql )

		- test.sql
			$ mysql -u rubbos rubbos < test.sql

	Change the PHP scripts for your user:
		- On line 5 of PHPprinter.php, change 'cecchet' to 'rubbos'
