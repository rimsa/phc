Version 1.2.2 from http://jmob.objectweb.org/rubbos.html doesn't work well for
PHP. However, there seems to be a lot of changes since 1.0, so its best to port
changes forward, rather than backwards (since the data is for 1.2.2).

Note that this is designed for PHP4. It seems to work out of the box with PHP5.

The following packages are used (debian/ubuntu):
	apache2
	libapache2-mod-php5
	php5-mysql
	mysql-server-5.0
	mysql-client-5.0
	tcsh
	java
	javac


The following webpages provide documentation:

	http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer/
		- Contains release 1.0, which includes the docs.

	http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer/dyna_bottleneck.pdf
		- Section 4 describes benchmarks utilization.
		- There is another paper of this ilk.


Howto run the benchmark:

Step 0 - get the benchmark and docs:

	Download v1.2.2 from:
		http://jmob.objectweb.org/rubbos.html

	Download v1.0 from:
		http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer/RUBBoS/download.html

	We use 1.2.2, and port some changes from 1.0 where 1.2.2 breaks.

	The docs are in the doc folder of the 1.0 download.


Step 1 - get the webserver running:

	I put a symlink to the RUBBos directory from within ~/public_html, and access it at
	http://localhost/~me/RUBBoS/

	apache needs the php module, and PHP needs the mysql module. On ubuntu:
		$ sudo a2enmod userdir
		$ sudo a2enmod php5

	None of the links work in this config, so they need to be patched. In the PHP/ directory:
		$ sed -i 's!/PHP/!!g' *.php
		$ sed -i 's!/PHP/!!g' *.html

Step 2 - Set up the databases

	Download the database:
		- http://download.forge.objectweb.org/rubbos/rubbos-expanded-dataset.tar.bz2

	Create a user for the database
		- I created 'rubbos' with no password (I did this with phpmyadmin, not sure how to do
		  otherwise).

	The database directory has 3 files to set up the DB:
		Create the tables and the DB.
			- I created a DB rubbos when I created the user, so didn't need the first line of rubbos.sql.
			$ mysql -u rubbos < rubbos.sql

		Load the data from the downloaded, unzipped rubbos-expanded-dataset into the database.
			- Need top change the filenames before executing.
			$ mysql -u rubbos rubbos < load.sql
				(I had a problem with this, so had to use
					$ mysql -u root rubbos < load.sql )

		- test.sql
			$ mysql -u rubbos rubbos < test.sql

	Change the PHP scripts for your user:
		- On line 5 of PHPprinter.php, change 'cecchet' to 'rubbos'


Step 3 - Build the client

	Move edu/ to make the Makefiles work. From the base directory:
		$ mv Client/edu .



Step 4 - Run the test

	Setup the workload files:

	Modify the benchamrk script:
		- 
	Run the benchmark script from bench/
		$ ./rubbos.sh
