PHPBench: http://www.pureftpd.org/project/phpbench

	PHPbench will need a bit of modification to do good work, which negates the point somewhat. It has a divide by zero in it, which we should remove, and also an infinite loop.

	It also loads tests like this (AKA dynamic class loading):
		$dir = opendir ($test_dir);
		while ($entry = readdir ($dir))
		{
			include_once ($entry);
		}

	Try optimizing that.

	We can hack it into the correct form though. Done.
	Wont compile though.

	It seems that this test really only tests language features, and doesnt
	actually do any work. Most of it will be optmized away (in the future) so
	its unlikely to be useful in the long run

PHP BS: http://phplens.com/benchmark_suite/

	A little bit complicated. Needs to change url loading into an include. I
	cant quite find where it calls the include or the eval or whatever, though.

	This does include quite a few tests, as well as input data, though not much
	of it, it seems.

Shootout: http://alioth.debian.org/scm/?group_id=30402

	The tests are in bench/test_name/test_name.php. I'm not sure how to call the
	test suite, although each test contains a command line.

Zend: $PHP_SRC/Zend/bench.php

	A nice simple test. You just run php bench.php and it runs, printing timing info. It wont compile either though.

Roadsend: http://www.roadsend.com/home/index.php?pageID=benchmarks

	Short, doesnt take command line parameters, is varied, but simple.
	Requires you to "export PCC_HOME=`pwd`" or similar, however.

	This seems to be the only test with data that needs to be run-through. This
	makes it a somewhat better test than the others, it seems.
