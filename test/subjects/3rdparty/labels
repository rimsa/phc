# All files will be found by recursive descent of directories, and each found
# file will be assigned the default labels. This is then overriden by matching
# each file against each line in this file, in order. The pattern is specified
# as a regex, but ! is used as a regex delimiter, so you can safely use / in
# the patterns. 
#
# Be aware that all files in a directory are specfied use 'dir/.*', not 'dir/*'.
#
# Possible labels:
#	- non-erroneous (default) or erroneous
#	- non-interpretable (default) or interpretable (interpretable means executable)
#	- long (default) or short
#	- size-neutral (default) or size-dependent
#	- non-includable (default) or includable
#	- no-test_name (don't run with a particular test)
#
# A common pattern would be to override some tests by adding, for example, the
# following to the bottom of the file:
#	.*				non-interpretable

## Examples
#
# general/.*								short interpretable
# bugs/.*									short interpretable
# bugs/bug0009.php						size-dependent
# general/foreach_error2.php			erroneous non-interpretable
# general/binops.php						no-CompiledVsInterpreted

## Long by default
.*		long

## Remove this to enable a test to check if files are safely interpretable
.* non-interpretable
