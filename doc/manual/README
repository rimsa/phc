phc's documentation now uses sphinx. On Debian/Ubuntu, install the
python-sphinx package (note, we use features of sphinx 0.6.x. At time of

There were previous failed experiments with latex and docbook, the latter being
too cumbersome to use in practice.

To make html documentation (which gets output in the .build directory), use
