<para> &phc has limited support for generating code, and can be used as a
front-end to parse PHP for other applications. This manual explains how to
compile and use &phc, and how to convert from PHP to XML and back. </para>

<note> <para> Documentation of the &phc API, including how to write plugins,
can be found in <xref linkend="devmanual">. </para> </note>

<para> The documentation for this and for older versions of &phc can be found
in the <ulink url="http://www.phpcompiler.org/src/archive/">archive</ulink>.
Moreover, although we have tried to document &phc as well as we can, if
anything is still unclear, please let us know by sending an email to the <ulink
