Test-suite
==========


You may test |phc| using:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   make test

This will only work if you have already `./configure`\d |phc|.

The output of the test suite is similar to:

.. sourcecode:: text

The columns indicate:

:P: Number of passes

:F: Number of failures

:T: Number of time-outs. We stop any test which runs for longer than 5 seconds.

:S: Number of skipped tests. In some cases, test subjects [#test_subjects]_
   which fail one test will also fail subsequent tests. We skip these instead.

As you can see, some failures are expected. Howver, if a test fails completely
(it has 0 passed tests), there may be a platform-dependent issue, which should
be `reported to the mailing-list <http://phpcompiler.org/mailinglist.html>`_.


Parallelizing
-------------

The tests can take a long time to run. If you have multiple processors on your machine, you may prefer to run tests in parallel. The test-suite looks for the environmental variable **PHC_NUM_PROCS**, which can be set for a session:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   export PHC_NUM_PROCS=4

or for one test iteration:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   PHC_NUM_PROCS=4 php test/framework/driver.php

A good argument for **PHC_NUM_PROCS** seems to be one-and-a-half time the number of cores in your available.




Options
-------

If you are developing |phc|, there are a lot of options to make it simpler. To
see them, run.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   php test/framework/driver.php -h


3rd-party tests
---------------

You can also add your own code to :file:`test/subjects/3rdparty/`, and test it by running:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   make long-test

to run the entire suite.


.. [#test_subjects] That is, the PHP files we keep in the `test/subjects/ directory <http://code.google.com/p/phc/source/browse/#svn/trunk/test/subjects/>`_.
