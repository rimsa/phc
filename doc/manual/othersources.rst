Other sources of information
============================

There are a number of other sources of information about |phc|, which for some
reason have not been integrated into the manual.

The `contribute page <http://www.phpcompiler.org/contribute.html>`_ on the
|phc| website links to a lot of resources that can help in |phc| development,
including |phc|'s project page.

The `documentation page <http://www.phpcompiler.org/documentation.html>`_ on
the |phc| website links to talks and papers on |phc|, as well as a few related
articles.


Some information is strewn in `README` files through the project directory, the
most important of which are:

*  `<http://code.google.com/p/phc/source/browse/trunk/README>`_
*  `<http://code.google.com/p/phc/source/browse/trunk/README.test>`_
*  `<http://code.google.com/p/phc/source/browse/trunk/README.svn>`_
*  `<http://code.google.com/p/phc/source/browse/trunk/README.profiling>`_
*  `<http://code.google.com/p/phc/source/browse/trunk/test/subjects/README.dirs>`_
*  `<http://code.google.com/p/phc/source/browse/trunk/doc/manual/README>`_
