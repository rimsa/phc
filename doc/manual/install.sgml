<warning> 
<para>These instructions only apply if you <emphasis>don't</emphasis> intend to
modify phc, and you are using a downloaded &phc release. If you intend to
modify it, or you are using the &phc <ulink
url="http://code.google.com/p/phc">SVN repository</ulink>, please refer to the
<link linkend="devintro">instructions for developers</link>. </para>
</warning>

<para> &phc needs a Unix-like environment to run (it has been tested on Linux,
Solaris, FreeBSD, Cygwin and Mac OS X).  To compile &phc, you will need:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>g++</code> <emphasis>version 3.4.0</emphasis> or higher</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>make</code></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>Boost</code> <emphasis>version 1.34</emphasis> or higher
(Debian package: <code>libboost-dev</code>)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The following dependencies are optional, but highly recommended</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>PHP5 embed SAPI</code> (version 5.2.x recommended; refer
to <link linkend="phpbuild">PHP embed SAPI build instructions</link> for more
details). This is required to compiler PHP code with &phc .</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><ulink url="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/">Xerces-C++</ulink>
(Debian package <code>libxerces27-dev</code>) if you want support for XML
parsing  (you don't need Xerces for XML unparsing).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>a DOT viewer such as <ulink
url="http://www.graphviz.org">graphviz</ulink> if you want to be able to view
the graphical output generated by &phc (for example, syntax
trees)</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para> It is possible to link &phc to the Boehm garbage collector (known as
<code>libgc</code> in many Linux distributions), but this feature is
experimental and seems to lead to runtime errors on some systems. Use with
care. </para>

<title>Installation Instructions</title>

<para>First of all, you must <ulink
url="http://www.phpcompiler.org/src">download</ulink> the latest release of
&phc, and save it to some temporary location, for example
<code>/tmp</code>.</para>

<para> Next you must decide where you want to extract &phc;. Here, we will
assume that you want to extract it to your home directory (<code>~</code>).
Extract &phc as follows.	</para>

<screen>
cd ~
tar xvfz /tmp/phc-0.2.0.tar.gz
</screen>
	
<para> This will create a new directory <code>~/phc-0.2.0</code> that
contains the &phc source tree. Finally, you must compile &phc;. If the
dependencies are in their standard locations, you should be able to simply type
</para>

<screen>
cd ~/phc-0.2.0
./configure
make
</screen>

<para> (Consult <code>./configure --help</code> for configuration options, if
your dependencies are not in standard locations). This should compile without
any warnings or errors. If this step fails, please send a bug report to the
<ulink url="http://www.phpcompiler.org/contact.html">mailing list</ulink> with
as much information about your system as you can give, and we will try to
resolve it.  Finally, install &phc using </para>

<screen>
make install
</screen>

<para> For information on running &phc, see <xref linkend="runningphc"
endterm="runningphc.title">.  If you can follow those instructions and you get
the output you should get, congratulations!  You have successfully installed
&phc :-) </para>

<title id="phpbuild">PHP SAPI embed build instructions</title>

<para>In order to compile code, &phc must have the PHP embed SAPI available,
which is typically not available via standard package managers. The embed SAPI
is also required for compiling stand-alone executables.</para>
