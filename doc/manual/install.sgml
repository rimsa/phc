<title>System Requirements</title>

<warning> 
<para>These instructions only apply if you <emphasis>don't</emphasis> intend to
modify phc, and you are using a downloaded &phc release. If you intend to
modify it, or you are using the &phc <ulink
url="http://code.google.com/p/phc">SVN repository</ulink>, please refer to the
<link linkend="devintro">instructions for developers</link>. </para>
</warning>

<para> &phc needs a Unix-like environment to run (it has been tested on Linux,
Solaris, FreeBSD, Cygwin and Mac OS X).  To compile &phc, you will need

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>gcc</code> <emphasis>version 3.4.0</emphasis> or higher
(other compilers may work too, but they need to support covariant return types;
YMMV)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>make</code></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>To make full use of &phc, you will also need</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><ulink url="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/">Xerces-C++</ulink>
if you want support for XML parsing  (you don't need Xerces for XML
unparsing).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a DOT viewer such as <ulink
url="http://www.graphviz.org">graphviz</ulink> if you want to be able to view
the graphical output generated by &phc (for example, syntax
trees)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para> It is possible to link &phc to the Boehm garbage collector (known as
<code>libgc</code> in many Linux distributions), but this feature is
experimental and seems to lead to runtime errors on some systems. Use with
care. </para>

<title>Installation Instructions</title>

<para>First of all, you must <ulink
url="http://www.phpcompiler.org/src">download</ulink> the latest release of
&phc, and save it to some temporary location, for example <code>/tmp</code>. If
<code>VERSION</code> is the version number of the copy of &phc you have
downloaded, the file will be called <code>phc-VERSION.tar.gz</code>. Thus, you
should now have a file <code>/tmp/phc-VERSION.tar.gz</code> (for example,
<code>/tmp/phc-0.1.6.tar.gz</code>). </para>

<para> Next you must decide where you want to extract &phc;. Here, we will
assume that you want to extract it to your home directory (<code>~</code>).
Extract &phc as follows.	</para>

<screen>
cd ~
tar xvfz /tmp/phc-VERSION.tar.gz
</screen>
	
<para> This will create a new directory <code>~/phc-VERSION</code> that
contains the &phc source tree. Finally, you must compile &phc;. You should be
able to simply type </para>

<screen>
cd ~/phc-VERSION
./configure
make
</screen>

<para> This should compile without any warnings or errors. If this step fails,
please send a bug report to the <ulink
url="http://www.phpcompiler.org/contact.html">mailing list</ulink> with as much
information about your system as you can give, and we will try to resolve it.
Finally, install &phc using </para>

<screen>
make install
</screen>

<para> For information on running &phc, see <xref linkend="runningphc"
endterm="runningphc.title">.  If you can follow those instructions and you get
the output you should get, congratulations!  You have successfully installed
&phc :-) </para>
