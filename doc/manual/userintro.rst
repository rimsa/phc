Introduction
============


|phc| has supports limited code generation, and can be used as a front-end to
parse PHP for other applications. This manual explains how to compile, install
and use |phc|, how to compile command-line and web applications, and how to
convert PHP to an XML reprentation, and back.

.. note:: 
   
   Documentation of the |phc| API, including how to write plugins,
   can be found in :ref:`devintro`.

The documentation for this and for older versions of |phc| can be found in the
`archive <http://www.phpcompiler.org/src/archive/>`_.  Moreover, although we
have tried to document |phc| as well as we can, if anything is still unclear,
please let us know by sending an email to the `mailing list
<http://www.phpcompiler.org/mailinglist.html>`_.
