NOTE: Before version 0.1.5, phc was distributed under the GNU GPL v2. 

phc is distributed under the BSD license, which is included in LICENSE.

Additionally, phc uses tools and code from several sources, each with their own
license, which we believe to be compatible with phc's BSD license. These are
listed below. You need to be aware of these if you plan on redistributing phc,
either as part of a product (open source or not), or if you plan on making
source or binary distributions (ie for use with dpkg, apt or emerge).

   php:
		- We base our parser on the Zend engine parser, which is licensed under
		  the Zend Engine License, version 2.0.
		- Read zend_engine_license_2_00.txt
		- "This product includes the Zend Engine, freely available at
		  http://www.zend.com".

   bison (GNU Bison >= 1.24): 
		- Read the preamble of php.tab.cpp
		- "/* As a special exception, when this file is copied by Bison into a
		  Bison output file, you may use that output file without restriction.
		  This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
		  version 1.24 of Bison.  */"

   flex (2.5.31)
		- Read the preamble of FlexLexer.h (probably in /usr/include/)
		- Flex output files do not generate license information. We assume they
		  are safe to use. The FlexLexer.h include file has a BSD license, which
		  needs to be addressed in binary distributions. Source distributions
		  would only need to comply if they redistributed FlexLexer.h.

   gengetopt (version 2.10):
		- Read the preamble in cmdline.c
		- "The developers of gengetopt consider the fixed text that goes in all
		  gengetopt output files to be in the public domain: we make no copyright
		  claims on it."

   gperf (GNU gperf 3.0.1):
		- No copyright notices are included in the output files.

RESPONSIBILITIES

If you plan on distributing software (source or binary) which includes phc,
whether as part of your own project, or when packaging phc (for example as an
rpm), you have the following responsibilities (to our knowledge):

	- You must include phc copyright notices in binary and source distributions
	  and abide by phc's BSD license.
	- You must include flex copyright notices (flex_copyright_notices.txt) in
	  binary distributions only and abide by flex's Modified BSD license.
	- You must abide by the acknowledgement and and advertising clauses from the
	  Zend license, and include the license in any distribution.
